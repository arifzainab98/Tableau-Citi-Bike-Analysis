Designed a Tableau dashboard using data sourced from Citi Bike, comparing bike trips between the winter and summer of 2023. The dashboard highlights the types of bikes used, popular destinations, and total trip counts. Various graphs and maps were utilized to illustrate peak ride times and popular stations.![image](https://github.com/arifzainab98/Tableau-Citi-Bike-Analysis/assets/143462852/21525a27-972a-449f-8df1-e13b45cb5c33)


Your task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.

1. Design 2–5 visualizations for each discovered phenomenon (4–10 total). You may work with a timespan of your choosing. Optionally, you can also merge multiple datasets from different periods.
2. Use your visualizations (not necessarily all of them) to design a dashboard for each phenomenon. The dashboards should be accompanied by an analysis explaining why the phenomenon may be occurring.
3. Create one of the following visualizations for city officials:

- Basic: A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey, with zip code data overlaid on top.
- Advanced: A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). Again, with zip code data overlaid on the map.
- The map you choose should also be accompanied by a write-up describing any trends that were noticed during your analysis.

4. Create your final presentation:

- Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
- Ensure your presentation is professional, logical, and visually appealing.

5. Your final submission should include:

- A link to your Tableau Public workbook that includes the following:
- 4–10 total "phenomenon" visualizations.
- 2 dashboards.
- 1 city official map.
- 1 story.
- A text or markdown file with your analysis of the phenomena you uncovered in the data.
